**5. Features / Highlights**

**• Business Problem**
Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types and city tiers. Business teams need a clear way to track performance differences by location, outlet size, and product category. Raw tables do not show trends, demand concentration, or underperforming segments clearly.

Key questions include:

Which outlet tier generates the highest sales?

Which product categories drive volume?

How does outlet size impact revenue?

Are customer ratings consistent across outlet types?

**• Goal of the Dashboard**

To provide an interactive performance view that:
Enables quick comparison of outlets by tier, size, and type
Highlights top and low-performing product categories
Supports inventory planning and outlet expansion decisions
Tracks long-term sales trends by outlet establishment year.
